Spaceship is fueled and we are rady to blast off to mars
We are docked in Spacestation, waiting for slinshot to mars
We are approaching mars, ready to landing
We have landed successfully on mars, it is strangely orange
The rover is going crazy on mars
Rover is scooping soil from the planet
Another day on mars
Third day on Mars
Fifth day on Mars
